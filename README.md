# Asus at Dell Master Tech Project

This is my First react project [see my project](https://asus-at-dell-master-tech.netlify.app/).

## `Project Description`

This is my First react project. I was scared When I first started the project I was facing a lot of errors. Now I am learning how to handle errors and in this project, first create a lot of product-card with button. When any one click the button, name of that card will added in another section and maximum number of four name will show then bellow of that list is another button that will show a random name from that list and another remove button will remove all of these. That's all for Today.
